## 1. Frontend (React and Next.js)

Since 2020, I've specialized in React ecosystem, later adopting Next.js in 2022 for building modern web applications. The stack incorporates TypeScript to ensure robust type safety and enhanced development experience. Each project follows the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) methodology, creating scalable and maintainable component architectures.

## 2. Styling (Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui)

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) serves as my primary styling solution, offering a utility-first approach for rapid development. Integrating [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components enables the creation of accessible, consistent interfaces while preserving complete design flexibility.

## 3. Backend (Golang & Node.js)

With Node.js experience since 2019 and Golang since 2021, I've developed a balanced approach to backend development. Node.js powers my MVP and smaller-scale projects, enabling quick iterations and fast development cycles. For enterprise applications demanding high performance, I implement solutions in Golang, leveraging its robust concurrency model and runtime efficiency.

## 4. Database (PostgreSQL)

Raw SQL queries form the foundation of my database interactions, providing precise control and optimal performance. The [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) library handles JavaScript implementations, while [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) manages Golang applications, ensuring type safety and query efficiency.

## 5. Infrastructure

My deployment architecture relies on [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for automation, Docker for containerization, and VPS for hosting. A comprehensive monitoring stack featuring Prometheus and Grafana tracks system health, with Nginx handling reverse proxy duties.
